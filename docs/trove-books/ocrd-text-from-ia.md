I've harvested 1,513 text files from the Internet Archive of 'Australian' books listed in Trove using the notebook above. Trove's 'Australian content' filter was used to try to limit the results to books published in, or about, Australia. However, this is not always accurate and some of the harvested works don't seem to have an Australian connection.
