title: Harvest Australian Women's Weekly covers (or the front pages of any newspaper)
description: Somewhat confusingly, the *Australian Women's Weekly* is in with Trove's digitised newspapers and not the rest of the magazines. There are notebooks in the GLAM Workbench's journals section to help harvest all of a journal's covers as images, so I thought I should do the same for the Weekly. This notebook can be easily adjusted to download the front pages of any digitised newspaper.
