title: Analyse rates of OCR correction 
description: The full text of newspaper articles in Trove is extracted from page images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The accuracy of the OCR process is influenced by a range of factors including the font and the quality of the images. Many errors slip through. Volunteers have done a remarkable job in correcting these errors, but it's a huge task. This notebook explores the scale of OCR correction in Trove.
