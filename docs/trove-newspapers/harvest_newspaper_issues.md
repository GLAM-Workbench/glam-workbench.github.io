title: Harvest information about newspaper issues
description: When you search Trove's newspapers, you find articles â€“ these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? On what dates were newspapers published? This notebook shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.
