title: Make composite images from lots of Trove newspaper thumbnails
description: This notebook starts with a search in Trove's newspapers. It uses the Trove API to work its way through the search results. For each article it creates a thumbnail image using the code from this notebook. Once this first stage is finished, you have a directory full of lots of thumbnails. The next stage takes all those thumbnails and pastes them one by one into a BIG image to create a composite, or mosaic.
