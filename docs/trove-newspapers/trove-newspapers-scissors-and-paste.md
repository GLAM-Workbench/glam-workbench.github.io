title: Create 'scissors and paste' messages from Trove newspaper articles
description: When you search for a term in Trove's digitised newspapers and click on individual article, you'll see your search terms are highlighted. If you look at the code you'll see the highlighted box around the word includes its page coordinates. That means that if we search for a word, we can find where it appears on a page, and by cropping the page to those coordinates we can create an image of an individual word. By combining these images we can create scissors and paste style messages!
