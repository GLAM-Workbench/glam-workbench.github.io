title: QueryPic 
description: This is the latest iteration of QueryPic with many new features. Use it to visualise searches in Trove's newspapers and gazettes, aggregating the number of results by day, month, or year. Simply copy and paste a url from a Trove web search to get started. QueryPic's charts help you explore patterns and trends, and if you find something interesting you can click on a point to view the results in Trove for that time period.
