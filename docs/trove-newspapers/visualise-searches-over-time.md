title: Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time
description: This notebook helps you zoom out and explore how the number of Trove newspaper articles in your search results varies over time by using the `decade` and year `facets`. We then combine this approach with other search facets to see how we can slice a set of results up in different ways to investigate historical changes.
