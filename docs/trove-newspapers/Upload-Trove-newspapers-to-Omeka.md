title: Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka-S
description: This notebook steps through the process of uploading Trove newspaper articles to your own Omeka-S instance via the API. As well as uploading the article metadata, it attaches image(s) and PDFs of the articles, and creates a linked record for the publishing newspaper. The source of the articles can be a Trove search, a Trove list, a Zotero collection, or just a list of article ids.
