title: Finding non-English newspapers in Trove
description: There are a growing number of non-English newspapers digitised in Trove. However, if you're only searching using English keywords, you might never know that they're there. I thought it would be useful to generate a list of non-English newspapers, but it wasn't quite as straightforward as I thought.
