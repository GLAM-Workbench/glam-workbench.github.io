title: Gathering historical data about the addition of newspaper titles to Trove 
description: The number of digitised newspapers available through Trove has increased dramatically since 2009. Understanding when newspapers were added is important for historiographical purposes, but there's no data about this available directly from Trove. This notebook uses web archives to extract lists of newspapers in Trove over time, and chart Trove's development.
