# Experimenting with automated image tagging in the Tribune negatives

Exploring [images from the Tribune negative collection](https://timsherratt.org/research-notebook/records-resistance/notes/tribune-metadata/) in the State Library of NSW.

These notebooks were created for students in the Exploring Digital Heritage class at the University of Canberra.

## Tools, tips, and examples

### [Basic image recognition with Tribune photos](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/image-recognition/blob/master/Basic%20image%20recognition%20with%20Tribune%20photos.ipynb)  
Trying Inception-v3's pre-trained model on some Tribune photos.

### [Tensorflow for poets](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/image-recognition/blob/master/Tensorflow-for-poets.ipynb)  
Notebook to accompany the [Tensorflow for poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/) tutorial

### [Training a classification model for the Tribune](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/image-recognition/blob/master/Training-a-classification-model-for-the-Tribune.ipynb)  
Using the 'Tensorflow for poets' example to create our own model.

### [Classifying all the Tribune images](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/image-recognition/blob/master/Classifying-all-Tribune-images.ipynb)
Using the simple model we created in the previous notebook, let's attempt to classify all the images in the Tribune collection.
