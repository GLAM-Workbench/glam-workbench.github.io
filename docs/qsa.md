## Tools, tips, and examples

### [Naturalisations, 1851-1904 — add series information](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/queensland-state-archives/blob/master/add_series_info_to_naturalisations_index.ipynb)  
The [Naturalisations, 1851 to 1904](https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/naturalisations-1851-to-1904) index is available from the Queensland Government data portal. It's not clear, however, that the index collates name entries from a number of different series, with a separate row for each name reference. This means that there can be multiple rows referring to the naturalisation of a single individual. This is obviously important to keep in mind if you're trying to analyse aggregate data relating to naturalisations in Queensland. This notebook adds series information to the original index so that you can filter the data by series.
