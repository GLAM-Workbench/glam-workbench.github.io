# Finding faces in the Tribune negatives

Exploring [mages from the Tribune negative collection](https://timsherratt.org/research-notebook/records-resistance/notes/tribune-metadata/) in the State Library of NSW.

These notebooks were created for students in the Exploring Digital Heritage class at the University of Canberra.

## Tools, tips, and examples

### [Finding faces in the Tribune collection](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/facial-detection/blob/master/Finding-faces-in-the-Tribune-collection.ipynb)  
Using OpenCV for basic facial detection.

### [Finding all the faces in the Tribune collection](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/facial-detection/blob/master/Finding-all-the-faces-in-the-Tribune-collection.ipynb)  
This notebook runs a facial detection script across the whole Tribune collection. It saves cropped versions of all the detected faces, and creates a data file recording the number of faces detected per image.

### [Exploring the face data](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/facial-detection/blob/master/Exploring-the-face-data.ipynb)  
This notebook plays around with the data generated by running the facial detection script over the whole Tribune collection.

### [Make all the faces into one big image](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/facial-detection/blob/master/Make-all-the-faces-into-one-big-image.ipynb)  
Having extracted lots and lots of faces from the Tribune photos, I thought I'd combine them in one big image.

## Interesting apps

### [Focus on faces](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/facial-detection/blob/master/focus-on-faces.ipynb)  
A little app that fades from faces to photos...
