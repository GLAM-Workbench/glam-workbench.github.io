Everyone know's about Trove's newspapers, but there is also a growing collection of digitised journals available in the journals zone. They're not easy to find, however, which is why I created the [Trove Titles](https://trove-titles.herokuapp.com/) web app. This notebook uses the Trove API to harvest metadata relating to periodicals available from Trove in digital form. As well as digitised publications, this includes born digital publications in formats like PDF and MOBI that have been made available through the edeposit program.
