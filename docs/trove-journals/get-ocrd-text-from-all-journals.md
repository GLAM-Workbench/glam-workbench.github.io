Using the code and data from other notebooks in this repository, you can download the OCRd text from every digitised journal. If you're going to try this, you'll need a lots of patience and lots of disk space. Needless to say, don't try this on a cloud service like Binder. Fortunately you don't have to do it yourself, as I've already run the harvest and made all the text files available. See below for details. I repeat, you probably don't want to do this yourself. The point of this notebook is really to document the methodology used to create the repository.
