In another notebook I showed how you could download all the front pages of The Bulletin (and other journals) as images. Amongst the front pages you'll find a number of full page editorial cartoons under The Bulletin's masthead. But you'll also find that many of the front pages are advertising wrap arounds. The full page editorial cartoons were a consistent feature of The Bulletin for many decades, but they moved around between pages one and eleven. That makes them hard to find. I wanted to try and assemble a collection of all the editorial cartoons, but how?
