## Australian government agencies

### [:material-notebook-outline: Create a Gannt chart of Australian government departments](agencies-gannt-timeline.md) {: data-toc-omit }
This notebook creates a Gannt-style chart showing the creation and dissolution dates of Australian government departments.

### [:material-notebook-outline: Create a network graph visualisation of Australian government departments](govt-agencies-network.md) {: data-toc-omit }
This notebook visualises changes in Australian government departments over time, using data from Wikidata. It creates a hierarchically-ordered network graph where each agency is represented as a node whose position and colour is determined by the decade in which the agency was created.

### [:material-notebook-outline: Visualise the connections of a single Australian government agency](single-agency-network.md) {: data-toc-omit }
Select an agency from the dropdown list to view its predecessors and successors as a network graph.
