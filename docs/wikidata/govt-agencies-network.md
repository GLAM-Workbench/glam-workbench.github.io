This notebook visualises changes in Australian government departments over time, using data from Wikidata. It creates a hierarchically-ordered network graph where each agency is represented as a node whose position and colour is determined by the decade in which the agency was created. The size of the node indicates how long the agency was in existence, while edges between nodes connect agencies to their successors. Earliest agencies will be at the top of the graph.
