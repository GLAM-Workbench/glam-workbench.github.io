## Using this notebook

=== "ARDC Binder"

    To run this notebook using the ARDC Binder service you'll need to log in using an account from an Australian university or research organisation. If you don't have an account, try [MyBinder](#__tabbed_1_2) instead.

    [Run live on ARDC Binder](https://binderhub.rc.nectar.org.au/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/{{repo_name}}/HEAD?urlpath=voila/render/{{notebook}}){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

=== "MyBinder"

    The MyBinder service doesn't require any authentication, but it can be slow to start and will sometimes fail when busy. If you have a login at an Australian university, you'll probably get better results with [ARDC Binder](#__tabbed_1_1).

    [Run live on MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/{{repo_name}}/HEAD?urlpath=voila/render/{{notebook}}){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

=== "Other options"

    Binder is great for experimentation and quick tasks, but for some projects you might need a dedicated, persistent environment in which to work. There's information on other options in the [run these notebooks](../#run-these-notebooks) section.
