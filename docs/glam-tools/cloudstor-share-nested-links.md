It's easy to create a public link to a file or folder in the CloudStor interface. But what if you have lots of files in nested folders that you want to make publicly accessible? Yes, you can share the parent folder, but how do you create direct public links to files and folders inside the parent folder without generating new share links for every resource.

This notebook demonstrates how to create links to resources nested within a shared folder. The code cells run some simple tests to try and make sure that the example links go where they're supposed to.
