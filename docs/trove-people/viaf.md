title: Get VIAF links relating to Trove People & Organisation records
description: VIAF, the Virtual International Authority File, aggregates identifiers for people and organisations from a wide range of name authority systems, including Libraries Australia. Many records in Trove's People & Organisations zone have Libraries Australia identifiers attached to them. Using these LA identifers it's possible to query VIAF for links related to a Trove record in other name authority systems.
