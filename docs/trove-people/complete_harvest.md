title: Harvesting the complete set of data from the People and Organisations zone
description: There are two methods of harvesting the complete set of data from the People and Organisations zone â€“ using the OAI-PMH API, or using the main Trove API in conjunction with the SRU interface. The OAI-PMH method is much faster, but includes duplicate records that you'll need to filter out afterwards. This notebook demonstrates the API/SRU method.
