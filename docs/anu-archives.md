## Sydney Stock Exchange records

The aim of this project is to try and extract useful data from the [Sydney Stock exchange stock and share lists](http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/or59j) held by the ANU Archives. As the content note indicates:

> These are large format bound volumes of the official lists that were posted up for the public to see - 3 times a day - forenoon, noon and afternoon - at the close of the trading session in the call room at the Sydney Stock Exchange. The closing prices of stocks and shares were entered in by hand on pre-printed sheets.

There are 199 volumes covering the period from 1901 to 1950, containing more than 70,000 pages. Each page is divided into columns. The number of columns varies across the collection. Each column is divided into rows labelled with printed company or stock names. The prices are written alongside the company names.

We're currently working on ways of extracting company and share names, as well as the handwritten prices, from the digitised images. For more information see [this repository](https://github.com/wragge/sydney-stock-exchange). The notebooks below provide ways of navigating, visualising, and using the digitised pages.

### Summary information about volumes

This notebook collates links and metadata relating to the 199 bound volumes in the Sydney Stock Exchange collection. It includes links to archival descriptions, records and PDFs in the research repository, and collections of individual page images stored on CloudStor. It also generates a CSV file with metadata for each page in the volume. For each volume a calculation of its completeness is attempted â€“ this is done by comparing the number of pages for each date with the expected number of pages and adding up the results.

### Calendar view of the complete collection

This notebook helps you see the number of stock and share sheets in the bound volumes from the Sydney Stock Exchange for each day from 1901 to 1950. You can pick out major changes such as when the number of sheets per day changed, and when Saturday trading finished. However, the bound volumes are not always complete. You'll notice some days have fewer sheets than expected or none at all. In using these records it's important to be aware of the gaps.

### Display information about a single day's trading

Select a date and this notebook will display information about any sheets that are available from this day. It notes where pages seem to be missing, and loads images of the pages for examination.

### Display details of pages within a date range

Select a date range and this notebook will display information about available sheets from all the days within the range. It notes where pages seem to be missing, and provides links to download page images.

### Data files

* [CSV-formatted list of all 70,000+ pages](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/complete_page_list.csv) in the bound volumes including their date and session (Morning, Noon, Afternoon). Duplicate images are excluded.
* [CSV-formatted list of all dates](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/complete_date_list.csv) within the period of the volumes. Includes the number of pages available for each date, and the number of pages expected (the number of pages produced each day changes across the collection). On dates with no pages, the `reason` field is used to record details of holidays or other interruptions to trading (some with links to Trove).
* [CSV-formatted list of holidays](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/nsw_holidays_1900_1950.csv) in NSW from 1901 to 1950.
* Full data about missing, misplaced, and duplicated pages is saved in [`page_data_master.py`](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/page_data_master.py). This data is combined with the holiday data to generate the complete page and date lists above.
