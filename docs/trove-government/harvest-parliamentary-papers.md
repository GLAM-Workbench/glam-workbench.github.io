title: Harvest details of Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers digitised in Trove
description: Trove includes thousands of digitised papers and reports presented to the Commonwealth Parliament. However, finding all the Parliamentary Papers is not straightforward because of inconsistencies in the way they've been arranged and described. This notebook attempts to work around these problems and harvest as complete as possible data about Parliamentary Papers in Trove.
