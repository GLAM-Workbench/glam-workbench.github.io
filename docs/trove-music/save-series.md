title: Save a list of oral history collections and projects
description: Oral histories are often grouped into collections or projects. The names of these collections can be found as  `series` in the `isPartOf` metadata field. This notebook extracts a list of series from a pre-harvested dataset of oral histories held by the NLA and described in Trove, and saves them to a text file.
