## Tips, tools, and examples

### Getting higher resolution versions of photos from the online collection interface  
The State Library of South Australia makes a fabulous collection of out of copyright photographs available online. However, while you can zoom in using their collection interface to examine the details of many of these images, the download option seems to provide copies at a much lower resolution. This limits their usefulness for many types of research. This notebook simply takes the tiled versions of the images which are displayed in the collection interface and stitches them together to create higher resolution versions.
