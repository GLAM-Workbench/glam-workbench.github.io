## Tips, tools, and examples

### Harvest ABC Radio National records from Trove
Trove harvests details of programs and segments broadcast on ABC Radio National. You can find them by searching for nuc:"ABC:RN" in the Music & Audio category. The records include basic metadata such as titles, dates, and contributors, but not full transcripts or audio. This notebook harvests, cleans, and saves all the available Radio National data from Trove.
