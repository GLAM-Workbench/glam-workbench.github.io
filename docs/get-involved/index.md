# Get involved!

There's lots of things you can do to help improve the GLAM Workbench. Here's a few possibilities.

## Become a sponsor

Work on the GLAM Workbench is supported by my generous [GitHub sponsors](supporters.md). Sponsorship tiers start at just $1/month.

## Spread the word

There's no point doing all this if no-one knows about it. I regularly post news using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GLAMWorkbench">#GLAMWorkbench</a> tag on Twitter, in my <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/categories/glamworkbench/">updates feed</a>, and on [OzGLAM Chat](https://ozglam.chat/c/glam-workbench/8). Please share!

## Report problems

There's a lot of notebooks in the GLAM Workbench, and it can be difficult to keep on top of everything. If you notice something's not working as expected, please let me know by creating a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench.github.io/issues">issue in GitHub</a>.

## Share ideas

You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench.github.io/issues">issues board</a> to jot down ideas for new notebooks or data sources.

## Add links to related resources

Within the GLAM Workbench are lists of useful resources, for example:

* [Sources of Australian GLAM data](../glam-data-list.md)
* [More GLAM tools and interfaces](../glam-tools-interfaces.md)
* [GLAM Jupyter resources](../more-glam-notebooks.md)

If something's missing from one of these lists, [please add it!](add-links.md)

## Improve the documentation

If you notice something that could be improved on this site, you can submit changes or additions. [See the documentation](editing-documentation.md) for more information.

## Contribute code

If you want to improve the GLAM Workbench's Jupyter notebooks, or add new notebooks to an existing repository, you can [contribute your own code](contribute-code.md).

## Develop a new repository

If you're part of a GLAM organisation that wants to encourage people to explore their collection data, why not develop your very own section of the GLAM Workbench? There's a [repository template](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench-template) and some [detailed documentation](developing-repositories.md) to get you started.

## Cite the workbench

If you use the GLAM Workbench in your research, please cite it. There are suggested citations at the bottom of most sections, and DOIs pointing to preserved versions of each repository in Zenodo.
