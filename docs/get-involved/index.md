# Get involved!

There's lots of things you can do to help improve the GLAM Workbench. Here's a few possibilities.

## Become a sponsor

Work on the GLAM Workbench is supported by generous [GitHub sponsors](supporters.md). Sponsorship tiers start at just $1/month.

## Spread the word

There's no point doing all this if no-one knows about it. I regularly post news using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GLAMWorkbench">#GLAMWorkbench</a> tag on Twitter, in my <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/categories/glamworkbench/">updates feed</a>, and on [OzGLAM Chat](https://ozglam.chat/c/glam-workbench/8). Please share!

## Report problems

There's a lot of notebooks in the GLAM Workbench, and it can be difficult to keep on top of everything. If you notice something's not working as expected, please let me know by creating a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench.github.io/issues">issue in GitHub</a>.


## Share ideas

You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench.github.io/issues">issues board</a> to jot down ideas for new notebooks or data sources.

## Cite the workbench

If you use the GLAM Workbench in your research, please cite it. There are suggested citations at the bottom of most sections, and DOIs pointing to preserved versions of each repository in Zenodo.

## Develop a new repository

If you're part of a GLAM organisation that wants to encourage people to explore their collection data, why not develop your very own section of the GLAM Workbench? There's a [repository template](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench-template) and some [detailed documentation](developing-repositories.md) to get you started.
