title: Exploring digitised maps in Trove
description: If you've ever poked around in Trove's 'map' zone, you might have noticed the beautiful deep-zoomable images available for many of the NLA's digitised maps. Even better, in many cases the high-resolution TIFF versions of the digitised maps are available for download. I knew there were lots of great maps you could download from Trove, but how many? And how big were the files? I thought I'd try to quantify this a bit by harvesting and analysing the metadata.
