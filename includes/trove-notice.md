!!! danger "Trove API access restrictions"
    **With the [cancellation of my Trove API keys](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2025/04/11/update-on-trove-data-access.html) by the National Library of Australia, I've [made the difficult decision to stop work on Trove](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2025/05/07/farewell-trove.html) and archive all related code repositories.**

    **The Trove sections of the GLAM Workbench will remain online, but they won't be updated. Everything here is openly-licensed, so feel free to take whatâ€™s useful and develop it further yourself.**

    **Given the fact that the NLA is willing to change the API terms of use to restrict access without any consultation, provides no transparency around acceptable use of full text content, and is willing to cancel API keys without warning, I can no longer recommend Trove as a reliable source for digital research.**
