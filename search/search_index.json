We want collections as data.</p> <p>This GLAM Workbench shows you how to create your own research datasets from a variety of GLAM collections. In some cases cultural institutions provide direct access to collection data through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or data downloads. In other cases we have to find ways of extracting data from web interfaces \u2013 a process known as screen-scraping.

It\u2019s a passion project that brings together a lot of work I\u2019ve been doing over the last 14 years to open GLAM collections to new research uses. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have help. </p> <p>Inevitably, there are overlaps between the GLAM Workbench and the one day a week I\u2019m employed by the Centre for Creative and Cultural Research at the University of Canberra. Indeed, our latest ARC Linkage grant specifically includes the development of resources for the GLAM Workbench in its outputs. I also do some paid work that ends up in the GLAM Workbench, such as the Sydney Stock Exchange project I've been working on with the ANU Archives.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also received a couple of grants and contracts over the last few years that have supported particular areas of the GLAM Workbench. The International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) contributed US$3,500 towards the development of the Web Archives section, as part of its Discretionary Funding program. In 2019 the HASS DeVL project contracted me ($12,000 over 6 months) to develop Jupyter notebooks using Trove and other GLAM sources. The HASS DeVL project no longer exists, but the notebooks I developed are still available and working \u2013 for example, the GLAM CSV Explorer, and many of the notebooks in the the Trove Journals section.</p> <p>I\u2019m particularly grateful for the support of my GitHub Sponsors (and those who previously supported me through Patreon). The amount I receive varies, but at the moment it\u2019s somewhere between AU$2-3,000 per annum. This makes a big contribution towards my cloud hosting costs, enabling the GLAM Workbench, and a range of related digital tools and projects, to keep chugging along. More than money though, the fact that people think this work is worth supporting really helps keep my motivation up!</p>"},{"location":"about/#is-the-glam-workbench-sustainable","title":"Is the GLAM Workbench sustainable?","text":"<p>Yes, I think so. To me, a sustainable project is one that is open to the future. My sustainability plan for the GLAM Workbench isn't based on having an institutional host or a steady stream of funding. It's based on the following ideas:</p> <ul> <li>Make everything open \u2013 If I go under a bus tomorrow, all of the notebooks will still be openly-licensed and accessible. If they are of use, people will fork the repositories, update the code, and share the results. If they're not, they'll fade gently into irrelevance.</li> <li>Small parts, loosly coupled \u2013 There is no underlying platform that needs to be maintained. Jupyter notebooks are just JSON files, structured according to an agreed standard, and can be deployed in a wide variety of environments. The GLAM Workbench uses existing services to run its notebooks, integrating with tools and platforms like Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar, and Docker. But it's not dependent on any of them. If a particular service disappears, something else can be swapped in.</li> <li>Automate the boring stuff \u2013 I'm increasingly making use of scripts and GitHub actions to do routine maintenance tasks like building Docker images, managing versions, and updating documentation. I hope to add more automated testing in the future. I forget things, so having tasks like these set up and running makes it easier for me to focus on development.</li> <li>Promote use and welcome collaboration \u2013 It's obvious, but important. The more a project is used and shared, the more likely it is to be maintained and developed. Outreach is hard, but crucial. One of my priorities at the moment is making it easier for others to contribute resources to the GLAM Workbench.</li> </ul> <p>The GLAM Workbench is itself an experiment, but it's already outlasted some well-funded research infrastructure projects. It won't live on forever in it's current form, but that doesn't mean it can't have a long-term impact. </p>"},{"location":"anu-archives/","title":"ANU Archives","text":""},{"location":"anu-archives/#current-version-v112","title":"Current version: v1.1.2","text":"<p>See below for information on running these notebooks in a live computing environment.

Jupyter notebooks are really just convenient ways of sharing bits of code. This code can be run, used, and edited on a variety of different platforms, and presented in a variety of different forms. In this case, the GLAM CSV Explorer notebook is being presented as an app, with all the code hidden from view.</p> <p>The GLAM Workbench is basically a big collection of Jupyter notebooks that help you explore data from libraries, archives, museums, and a range of other data sources. Here are some other notebooks that you can run as apps (click on the links to open them using Binder):</p> <ul> <li>QueryPic \u2013 visualise searches in Trove's digitised newspapers</li> <li>Trove Newspaper Harvester \u2013 download newspaper articles in bulk</li> <li>Display changes in the text of an archived web page over time</li> <li>Create 'scissors and paste' messages from Trove newspaper articles</li> </ul> <p>But that's just the beginning. To make full use of the GLAM Workbench you need to understand a bit about how Jupyter notebooks work. Once you've mastered the basics you can use any notebook on this site.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#introducing-jupyter-notebooks","title":"Introducing Jupyter notebooks","text":"<p>Jupyter notebooks combine text, images, and live code within a single web page. So not only can you read about GLAM collections data, you can download it, analyse it, and visualise it \u2013 all within your browser!</p> <p>If you'd like to see what Jupyter notebooks can do, I've created an introductory notebook that walks you through the basic conventions and lets you play with some live data from the National Museum of Australia. This notebook is presented in the 'classic' notebook view, with all the code exposed. Don't let the code make you nervous! No programming knowledge is needed to use this notebook, or many of the other notebooks in the GLAM Workbench.</p> <p>Click here to launch the Getting Started notebook.</p> <p>Clicking this link will open the getting started notebook using Jupyter Lite, a version of Jupyter that runs completely in your browser.</p> <p>Notebooks are made up up cells that can contain text or code. You can run the code cells to do things \u2013 get some data, or create a visualisation. You can also edit the code cells to enter your own information, or change the results. This slideshow provides a quick primer.</p> <p>There's really only a few things you need to know to use any of the Jupyter notebooks in the GLAM Workbench. Here's all the basics!</p> <p>Jupyter notebook quick tips</p> <ul> <li>Notebooks include both text cells and code cells.</li> <li>Code cells have boxes around them.</li> <li>To run a code cell click on the cell and then hit Shift+Enter. The Shift+Enter combo will also move you to the next cell, so it\u2019s a quick way to work through the notebook.</li> <li>While a cell is running a * appears in the square brackets next to the cell. Once the cell has finished running the asterix will be replaced with a number.</li> <li>In most cases you\u2019ll want to start from the top of notebook and work your way down running each cell in turn. Later cells might depend on the results of earlier ones.</li> <li>To edit a code cell, just click on it and type stuff. Remember to run the cell once you\u2019ve finished editing.</li> </ul> <p>For a more detailed introduction to Jupyter notebooks and why they're of use to researchers in the humanities, see this tutorial by Quinn Dombrowski, Tassie Gniady, and David Kloster in The Programming Historian.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#using-the-glam-workbench","title":"Using the GLAM Workbench","text":"<p>The GLAM Workbench is organised around collections, rather than tools or methods. The aim is to get you working with real data related to your research as soon as possible. This is reflected in the site navigation, which is divided up into sectors and institutions, with a few extra headings for aggregated collections like Trove and DigitalNZ. Just look for something that interests you and dive in.</p> <p>Here's a quick guide to help you find your way around.</p> <p>Each section within the GLAM Workbench includes a list of Jupyter notebooks that work with data from that collection. There may also be links to some pre-harvested datasets. The notebooks take a variety of different approaches and forms. Some help you create your own datasets for further analysis. Some are focused on ways of visualising collections. Some are quick hacks to help you workaround the limitations of collection interfaces. And some are detailed tutorials that walk you though the possibilities of the available data. As noted above, some notebooks run as standalone apps, while others expose all their workings.</p> <p>There's no one pathway through the GLAM Workbench. You can pick and choose based on your interests, needs, and skills.</p> <p>Underneath the descriptions of most notebooks you'll find a series of links. All the links take you to a copy of the notebook, but what you can do with the notebook varies according to the environment in which it's loaded. A typical set of links might include:</p> <ul> <li>Download from GitHub</li> <li>View on NBViewer</li> <li>Run live on Binder</li> </ul> <p>The links to GitHub and NBViewer take you to static versions of the notebook that you can read and download, but you can't run any of the code. The link to Binder loads a live version in a customised computing environment. More details of each of these are included below.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#download-from-github","title":"Download from GitHub","text":"<p>Each section of the GLAM Workbench has its own GitHub repository where the notebooks and any related data files are stored. If you have Jupyter set up on your own computer and you want to play around with one of the notebooks, then you probably want to download it from GitHub and run it locally. GitHub also shows you the history of a notebook \u2013 so you can check if anything has changed.</p> <p>When you open a Jupyter notebook in GitHub, it tries to display a nicely formatted static version. But it doesn't always work, and the formatting can be a bit off.

Once Binder is ready, you'll be able to use the notebook live within your web browser. However, if you make any changes or harvest any data, Binder won't save them for you. You'll have to make sure you download any files you want to keep. In many cases the notebooks themselves will generate download links to make it easy for you to save your results. Binder sessions will also stop responding after after a period of inactivity \u2014 just start a new session.</p> <p>There's more information on the Using Binder page.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#running-notebooks-as-apps","title":"Running notebooks as apps","text":"<p>You might also come across links that open notebooks using Appmode or Voil\u00e0.

To do this you need to understand a couple of things. First, Reclaim Cloud environments are essentially wrappers around application 'nodes'. One environment might contain multiple nodes, each running a different application. The GLAM Workbench environments contain a single node that packages up everything you need to run Jupyter and the GLAM Workbench notebooks. It's possible to update this node, without changing the environment.</p> <p>But if you simply update the node, then all of your changes will be lost. To preserve them between updates you have to move them outside of the Jupyter node. For this reason, the GLAM Workbench installation process creates a special directory called <code>work</code>. You'll see it in the Jupyter file explorer. But while you can see <code>work</code> from within Jupyter, it's actually sitting outside the node. Anything saved in the <code>work</code> directory exists independently of the node.</p> <p>So, to update a GLAM Workbench repository:</p> <ul> <li>Copy any modified notebooks or datasets that you want to keep to the <code>work</code> directory.</li> <li> <p>Click on the &gt; arrow next to the environment name to show the node.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Hover over the node name to show the option buttons.</p> </li> <li>Click on Redeploy button</li> <li> <p>A dialogue box will pop up. Make sure 'Keep volumes data' is set to 'ON'.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Click on the Redeploy button.</p> </li> <li>Click Yes to confirm.</li> <li>The Reclaim Cloud control panel will let you know when the node has been updated. Once again, you might have to wait a couple of minutes before you can run it in your browser.</li> <li>Note that your password, and the url of your Jupyter instance will not have changed, but the notebooks will have been updated.</li> <li>You can now copy your modifications back from <code>work</code> to the main directory.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"running-notebooks/#using-ssh-and-rsync-to-save-files-advanced","title":"Using SSH and Rsync to save files (advanced)","text":"<p>If you want to maintain a complete backup of the files in your Reclaim Cloud environment on your local computer you can use Rsync.

To do this you need to understand a couple of things. First, Reclaim Cloud environments are essentially wrappers around application 'nodes'. One environment might contain multiple nodes, each running a different piece of software. The GLAM Workbench environments contain a single node that packages up everything you need to run the GLAM Workbench notebooks using Jupyter. It's possible to update this node, without changing the environment.</p> <p>However, updating the node will replace all your files, so any changes will be lost. To preserve your changes between updates you first have to move them outside of the Jupyter node. To help with this, the GLAM Workbench installation process creates a special directory called <code>work</code>. You'll see it in the Jupyter file explorer. But while you can see <code>work</code> from within Jupyter, it's actually sitting outside the node. Anything you save in the <code>work</code> directory won't be replaced when you update the Jupyter node.</p> <p>So, to update a GLAM Workbench repository:</p> <ul> <li>Copy any modified notebooks or datasets that you want to keep to the <code>work</code> directory.</li> <li> <p>Click on the &gt; arrow next to the environment name to show the node.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Hover over the node name to show the option buttons.</p> </li> <li>Click on Redeploy button</li> <li> <p>A dialogue box will pop up.

But if your CSV has millions of rows it'll probably make your web browser unhappy if you try and load it in Datasette-Lite. Instead you can make use of Datasette's 'publish' option to push your data to a dedicated Datasette instance running on a cloud server. You can also customise your instance by changing the theme or using canned queries.</p> <p>For example, the GLAM Name Index Search contains more than 10 millions rows of data from multiple datasets, all aggregated through a single search interface. The Tasmanian Post Office Directories provides full-text search across 48 digitised volumes and has a heavily customised interface that displays page images as well as the OCRd content. Both of these Datasette instances are hosted on Google Cloudrun.</p> <p>Similarly, the method described here is designed to work with single CSV files. If you have multiple, interconnected tables you'll probably want to generate your own SQLite database to use with Datasette. There's an example of how you can do this in the Enrich the list of periodicals from the Trove API notebook.</p>"},{"location":"heritage-council-of-victoria/","title":"Heritage Council of Victoria","text":""},{"location":"heritage-council-of-victoria/#current-version-v110","title":"Current version: v1.1.0","text":"<p>A collection of examples using the Victorian Heritage Database API.</p>"},{"location":"heritage-council-of-victoria/#tips-tools-and-examples","title":"Tips, tools, and examples","text":""},{"location":"heritage-council-of-victoria/#introduction-to-the-victorian-heritage-database-api","title":"Introduction to the Victorian Heritage Database API","text":"<p>An introduction to the Victorian Heritage Database API, showing how to construct basic queries and the sorts of results that are returned</p>"},{"location":"heritage-council-of-victoria/#shipwrecks-in-the-victorian-heritage-database","title":"Shipwrecks in the Victorian Heritage Database","text":"<p>Explores what you can find out about shipwrecks using the Victorian Heritage Database API.</p>"},{"location":"heritage-council-of-victoria/#run-these-notebooks","title":"Run these notebooks","text":"<p>There are a number of different ways to use these notebooks.

Or perhaps you want to examine differences in the way particular newspapers talk about an event by grouping the articles by newspaper. This notebook provides a slice and dice wonder tool for Trove newspaper harvests, enabling you to repackage OCRd text by decade, year, and newspaper title.

See the Trove Newspaper Harvester documentation for full details. The Harvesting articles that mention \"Anzac Day\" on Anzac Day provides an example of this.</p> <p>There will be at least three files created for each harvest:</p> <ul> <li><code>harvester_config.json</code> a file that captures the parameters used to launch the harvest</li> <li><code>ro-crate-metadata.json</code> a metadata file documenting the harvest in RO-Crate format</li> <li><code>results.csv</code> contains details of all the harvested articles in a plain text CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.

You can convert the <code>ndjson</code> file to CSV using the <code>Harvester.save_csv()</code> method. The <code>results.ndjson</code> stores the API results from Trove as is, with a couple of exceptions:</p> <ul> <li>if the <code>text</code> parameter has been set to <code>True</code>, the <code>articleText</code> field will contain the path to a <code>.txt</code> file containing the OCRd text contents of the article (rather than containing the text itself)</li> <li>similarly if PDFs and images are requests, the <code>pdf</code> and <code>image</code> fields int the <code>ndjson</code> file will point to the saved files.</li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019ve asked for text files PDFs or images, there will be additional directories containing those files. Files containing the OCRd text of the articles will be saved in a directory named <code>text</code>. These are just plain text files, stripped on any HTML. These files include some basic metadata in their file titles \u2013 the date of the article, the id number of the newspaper, and the id number of the article. So, for example, the filename <code>19460104-1002-206680758.txt</code> tells you:</p> <ul> <li><code>19460104</code> \u2013 the article was published on 4 January 1946 (YYYYMMDD)</li> <li><code>1002</code> \u2013 the article was published in The Tribune</li> <li><code>206680758</code> \u2013 the article's unique identifier</li> </ul> <p>As you can see, you can use the newspaper and article ids to create direct links into Trove:</p> <ul> <li>to a newspaper or gazette <code>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/[newspaper id]</code></li> <li>to an article <code>http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article[article id]</code></li> </ul> <p>Similarly, if you've asked for copies of the articles as images, they'll be in a directory named <code>image</code>. The image file names are similar to the text files, but with an extra id number for the page from which the image was extracted. So, for example, the image filename <code>19250411-460-140772994-11900413.jpg</code> tells you:</p> <ul> <li><code>19250411</code> \u2013 the article was published on 11 April 1925 (YYYYMMDD)</li> <li><code>460</code> \u2013 the article was published in The Australasian</li> <li><code>140772994</code> \u2013 the article's unique identifier</li> <li><code>11900413</code> \u2013 the page's unique identifier (some articles can be split over multiple pages)</li> </ul> <p>Once you have your data you can start exploring!

See the Trove Newspaper Harvester documentation for full details. The Harvesting articles that mention \"Anzac Day\" on Anzac Day provides an example of this.</p> <p>There will be at least three files created for each harvest:</p> <ul> <li><code>harvester_config.json</code> a file that captures the parameters used to launch the harvest</li> <li><code>ro-crate-metadata.json</code> a metadata file documenting the harvest in RO-Crate format</li> <li><code>results.csv</code> contains details of all the harvested articles in a plain text CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.

You can convert the <code>ndjson</code> file to CSV using the <code>Harvester.save_csv()</code> method. The <code>results.ndjson</code> stores the API results from Trove as is, with a couple of exceptions:</p> <ul> <li>if the <code>text</code> parameter has been set to <code>True</code>, the <code>articleText</code> field will contain the path to a <code>.txt</code> file containing the OCRd text contents of the article (rather than containing the text itself)</li> <li>similarly if PDFs and images are requests, the <code>pdf</code> and <code>image</code> fields int the <code>ndjson</code> file will point to the saved files.</li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019ve asked for text files PDFs or images, there will be additional directories containing those files. Files containing the OCRd text of the articles will be saved in a directory named <code>text</code>. These are just plain text files, stripped on any HTML. These files include some basic metadata in their file titles \u2013 the date of the article, the id number of the newspaper, and the id number of the article. So, for example, the filename <code>19460104-1002-206680758.txt</code> tells you:</p> <ul> <li><code>19460104</code> \u2013 the article was published on 4 January 1946 (YYYYMMDD)</li> <li><code>1002</code> \u2013 the article was published in The Tribune</li> <li><code>206680758</code> \u2013 the article's unique identifier</li> </ul> <p>As you can see, you can use the newspaper and article ids to create direct links into Trove:</p> <ul> <li>to a newspaper or gazette <code>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/[newspaper id]</code></li> <li>to an article <code>http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article[article id]</code></li> </ul> <p>Similarly, if you've asked for copies of the articles as images, they'll be in a directory named <code>image</code>. The image file names are similar to the text files, but with an extra id number for the page from which the image was extracted. So, for example, the image filename <code>19250411-460-140772994-11900413.jpg</code> tells you:</p> <ul> <li><code>19250411</code> \u2013 the article was published on 11 April 1925 (YYYYMMDD)</li> <li><code>460</code> \u2013 the article was published in The Australasian</li> <li><code>140772994</code> \u2013 the article's unique identifier</li> <li><code>11900413</code> \u2013 the page's unique identifier (some articles can be split over multiple pages)</li> </ul> <p>Once you have your data you can start exploring!

Unfortunately, there are no facets to help separate the different types of content, and so the finding aids can get a bit swamped. For example, you might think that searching for <code>findingaid \"nla.obj\"</code> would help identify the NLA's digitised finding aids, but this search returns 153,345 results, most of which are items within finding aids, rather than the finding aids themselves. I've yet to find a search in Trove that can reliably isolate the digitised finding aids. (Searching for 'finding aid' in the manuscripts section of the NLA catalogue gets close.) Nor can I find a complete list of finding aids elsewhere on the NLA site.

But web archives don't just store old web pages, they capture multiple versions of web resources over time. Using web archives we can observe change \u2013 we can ask historical questions. This collection of notebooks is intended to help historians, and other researchers, frame those questions by revealing what sort of data is available, how to get it, and what you can do with it.</p> <p>Web Archives share systems and standards, making it much easier for researchers wanting to get their hands on useful data. These notebooks focus on four particular web archives: the UK Web Archive, the Australian Web Archive (National Library of Australia ), the New Zealand Web Archive (National Library of New Zealand), the Internet Archive, and the UK Goverment Web Archive. However, the tools and approaches here could be easily extended to other web archives.</p> <p>Web archives are huge, and access is often limited for legal reasons. These notebooks focus on data that is readily accessible and able to be used without the need for special equipment. They use existing APIs to get data in manageable chunks. But many of the examples demonstrated can also be scaled up to build substantial datasets for analysis \u2013 you just have to be patient!</p> <p>These notebooks are a starting point that I hope will encourage researchers to investigate the possibilities of web archives in more detail. They're intended to compliment the fabulous work being by projects such as Archives Unleashed to open web archives to new research uses.</p> <p>The development of these notebooks was supported by the International Internet Preservation Consortium's Discretionary Funding Programme 2019-2020, with the participation of the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand.
