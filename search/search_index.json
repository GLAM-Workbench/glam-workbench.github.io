What is GLAM data? \u00b6 When we talk about GLAM data we\u2019re usually referring to the collections held by cultural institutions \u2013 books, manuscripts, photographs, objects, and much more. We\u2019re used to exploring these collections through online search interfaces or finding aids, but sometimes we want to do more \u2013 instead of a list of search results on a web page, we want access to the underlying collection data for analysis, enrichment, or visualisation. We want collections as data . This GLAM Workbench shows you how to create your own research datasets from a variety of GLAM collections. In some cases cultural institutions provide direct access to collection data through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or data downloads. In other cases we have to find ways of extracting data from web interfaces \u2013 a process known as screen-scraping. Here you\u2019ll find examples of all these approaches, as well as links to a number of pre-harvested datasets. What can I do with GLAM data? \u00b6 Ask different types of questions!

It's aimed at researchers in the humanities, but will include examples and tutorials of more general interest. Over the past decade I've created and shared a wide variety of digital tools, examples, tutorials, and datasets. Some like QueryPic and TroveHarvester are fairly polished and well documented. Others are just fragments of code. All of them are intended to support research into our rich cultural collections. But even though something like the TroveHarvester is pretty easy to use, it does require a bit of set-up, and I've been very aware that this can be a barrier to people starting their explorations. I created the dhistory site many years ago to provide the foundation for a digital workbench, but I couldn't quite achieve what I wanted \u2014 tools that were easy to use and required minimal setup, but also tools that exposed their own workings, that inspired novice users to question and to tinker. So here we are. My plan is to use Jupyter , GitHub, and Binder to bring together all those tools, examples, tutorials, and datasets in a way that supports people's explorations through digital GLAM collections. I'm really excited, for example, that I can create a notebook that provides a deconstructed (or perhaps see-through) version of QueryPic \u2014 that enables you to build, step by step, the same sort of visualisations, while learning about how it works. And at the end you can download the results as a CSV for further analysis. I love the way that Jupyter notebooks combine learning with real, live, digital tools and methods. You don't have to read a tutorial then go away and try to follow the instructions on your own. It's all together. Live code. Real research. Active learning. Like most of my projects this is in itself an experiment. I'm still learning what's possible and what works. But I'm hopeful. If you think this project is worthwhile, you might like to support me on Patreon .","title":"Some background"},{"location":"archway/","text":"Archway \u00b6 Archway is the collections database of Archives New Zealand and provides rich, contextual information about records, series, agencies, and functions.

Jupyter lets you combine text, images, and live code within a single web page. So not only can you read about GLAM collections data, you can download it, analyse it, and visualise it \u2013 all within your browser! If you'd like to dive straight in and see what Jupyter notebooks can do, I've created an introductory notebook that walks you through the basic conventions and lets you play with some data from the National Museum of Australia. Don't let the code make you nervous! No programming knowledge is needed to use this notebook, or many of the other notebooks in the GLAM Workbench. Click here to launch this notebook When you click on the link above you'll be transferred to Binder , a service that loads Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. Binder will set up a customised computing environment that includes all the software you'll need to run the notebook in your browser. It can take 30 seconds or more to load everything, so be patient. Once the notebook has loaded, just follow the instructions! For a more detailed introduction to Jupyter notebooks and why they're of use to researchers in the humanities, see this tutorial by Quinn Dombrowski, Tassie Gniady, and David Kloster in The Programming Historian . Jupyter notebook quick tips Code cells have boxes around them. To run a code cell click on the cell and then hit Shift+Enter . The Shift+Enter combo will also move you to the next cell, so it\u2019s a quick way to work through the notebook. While a cell is running a * appears in the square brackets next to the cell. Once the cell has finished running the asterix will be replaced with a number. In most cases you\u2019ll want to start from the top of notebook and work your way down running each cell in turn. Later cells might depend on the results of earlier ones. To edit a code cell, just click on it and type stuff. Remember to run the cell once you\u2019ve finished editing. Static or live \u2013 different ways of viewing and using Jupyter notebooks \u00b6 Underneath the descriptions of most notebooks included in the GLAM Workbench you'll find a series of links. All the links take you to a copy of the notebook, but what you can do with the notebook varies according to the environment in which it's loaded. A typical set of links might include: Download from GitHub View on NBViewer Run live on Binder The links to GitHub and NBViewer take you to static versions that you can read and download, but you can't run any of the code. The link to Binder loads a live version in a customised computing environment. More details of each of these are included below. Let's say you're exploring the Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench and notice the visualise Trove newspaper searches over time notebook. You might first click on the NBViewer link to browse the contents of the notebook. If you decide it looks interesting and want to try running some of the examples live you could click on the Binder link . After a while you might decide you want to create your own customised version of this notebook. You could then use the GitHub link to download the source code. Download from GitHub \u00b6 Each section of the GLAM Workbench has its own GitHub repository where the notebooks and any related data files are stored. If you have Jupyter set up on your own computer and you want to play around with one of the notebooks, then you probably want to download it from GitHub and run it locally. GitHub also shows you the history of a notebook \u2013 so you can check if anything has changed. When you open a Jupyter notebook in GitHub, it tries to display a nicely formatted static version. But it doesn't always work, and the formatting can be a bit off. If all you want to do is view the contents of a notebook, then you're probably better off using NBViewer. View on NBViewer \u00b6 NBViewer displays a nicely formatted copy of a Jupyter notebook. It's the quickest and most reliable way of examining the content of a notebook. However, this is a static view. The interactive Jupyter notebook has been turned into an HTML file. You can't run code cells or edit the contents of the notebook. You can look, but you can't do. If you want to try running the code in a Jupyter notebook (and that's what they're for), then you might want to give Binder a try. Run live on Binder \u00b6 Binder is a cloud-based service for running Jupyter notebooks. When you click on the link, Binder opens the notebook within a customised computing environment with all the software you'll need ready to go. This can take a little while \u2014 just be patient. Once Binder is ready, you'll be able to use the notebook live within your web browser. However, if you make any changes or harvest any data, Binder won't save them for you. You'll have to make sure you download any files you want to keep. In many cases the notebooks themselves will generate download links to make it easy for you to save your results. Binder sessions will also stop responding after after a period of inactivity \u2014 just start a new session. Running notebooks as apps \u00b6 You might also come across links that open notebooks using Appmode or Voil\u00e0 . These are live versions that hide the notebook's code and run all the cells automatically. This means you can make a notebook available with a nice clean interface for those who might be a little intimidated by a page full of code. Running notebooks on your own computer \u00b6 Using Python 3 \u00b6 It's best to keep your GLAM Workbench repositories in separate virtual environments. This means you can install the software versions that you need without upsetting anything else. For example, if you wanted to set up your own version of the Trove newspapers repository, you'd start by creating a new virtual environment. 1 2 3 python3 -m venv trove-newspapers cd trove-newspapers source bin/activate You can then clone the GitHub repository into your virtual environment. 1 git clone https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers.git Finding the clone url To get the url you need to clone one of the GLAM Workbench's GitHub repositories, just do the following: Go to the section of the GLAM Workbench you want to clone. Click on the repository link in the top menu bar (look for the Octocat! ) Click on the green Clone or download button and copy the link. Each repository in the GLAM Workbench contains a requirements.txt file that lists all of the Python packages needed to run the notebooks. Use cd to move into the cloned folder and then use pip to install everything you need. 1 2 cd trove-newspapers pip install -r requirements.txt Using Anaconda \u00b6 ~~~ Coming soon ~~~","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#introducing-jupyter-notebooks","text":"This GLAM Workbench includes many Jupyter notebooks.

Click on the repository link in the top menu bar (look for the Octocat! ) Click on the green Clone or download button and copy the link. Each repository in the GLAM Workbench contains a requirements.txt file that lists all of the Python packages needed to run the notebooks.

Based on the series system , RecordSearch provides rich, contextual information about series, items, agencies, and functions. Unfortunately RecordSearch doesn't provide access to machine-readable data through an API, so we have to resort to screen scraping.

This may not be complete, but it seems like a useful starting point.

To keep down the file size and avoid too much duplication it doesn't include the full range of relationships that an agency might have. If you want the full agency data, use the app below to harvest agencies associated with an individual function or hierarchy. Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder Download the contents of a digitised file \u00b6 RecordSearch lets you download a PDF of a digitised file, but sometimes it's more convenient to work with individual images.

Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder in Appmode Get a list of agencies associated with a function \u00b6 RecordSearch describes the business of government in terms of 'functions'. A function is an area of responsibility assigned to a particular government agency. Over time, functions change and move between agencies. If you're wanting to track particular areas of government activity, such as 'migration' or 'meteorology', it can be useful to start with functions, then follow the trail through agencies, series created by those agencies, and finally items contained within those series. This app makes it easy for you to download a list agencies associated with a particular function. Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder in Appmode Who's responsible? \u00b6 The National Archives of Australia's RecordSearch database divides government activities up into a series of functions. Over time, different agencies have been made responsible for these functions, and it can be interesting to track how these responsibilities have shifted.

Just give it a search from the Trove web interface, and the harvester will save the metadata of all the articles in a CSV (spreadsheet) file for further analysis. You can also save the full text of every article, as well as copies of the articles as JPG images, and even PDFs. While the web interface will only show you the first 2,000 results matching your search, the Newspaper & Gazette Harvester will get everything . You can install the Harvester as a Python command line tool , or use it in one of these notebooks below: Using TroveHarvester to get newspaper and gazette articles in bulk \u2013 shows you how to use the command line tool in a Jupyter notebook Trove Harvester web app \u2013 provides a simple web interface to the newspaper & gazette harvester Both notebooks can be run live, online using the Binder service, so you can start harvesting articles straight away without installing any software. All you need to get started is: A search url \u2013 just construct your search using the Trove web interface ), and when you're happy with the results, copy the url. A Trove API key . Your harvested data \u00b6 When you start a new harvest, the harvester looks for a directory called data . Within this directory it creates another directory for your harvest. The name of this directory will be in the form of a unix timestamp \u2013 a very large number that represents the number of seconds since 1 January 1970. So this means the directory with the largest number will contain the most recent harvest. The harvester saves your results inside this directory. There will be at least two files created for each harvest: results.csv \u2013 a text file containing the details of all harvested articles metadata.json \u2013 a configuration file which stores all the details of the harvest The results.csv file is a plain text CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. You can open it with any spreadsheet program. The details recorded for each article are: article_id \u2013 a unique identifier for the article title \u2013 the title of the article newspaper_id \u2013 a unique identifier for the newspaper or gazette title (this can be used to retrieve more information or build a link to the web interface) newspaper_title \u2013 the name of the newspaper (or gazette) page \u2013 page number (of course), but might also indicate the page is part of a supplement or special section date \u2013 in ISO format, YYYY-MM-DD category \u2013 one of \u2018Article\u2019, \u2018Advertising\u2019, \u2018Detailed lists, results, guides\u2019, \u2018Family Notices\u2019, or \u2018Literature\u2019 words \u2013 number of words in the article illustrated \u2013 is it illustrated (values are y or n) corrections \u2013 number of text corrections url \u2013 the persistent url for the article page_url \u2013 the persistent url of the page on which the article is published If you\u2019ve asked for PDFs or text files, there will be additional directories containing those files. Files containing the OCRd text of the articles will be saved in a directory named text . These are just plain text files, stripped on any HTML. These files include some basic metadata in their file titles \u2013 the date of the article, the id number of the newspaper, and the id number of the article. So, for example, the filename 19460104-1002-206680758.txt tells you: 19460104 \u2013 the article was published on 4 January 1946 (YYYYMMDD) 1002 \u2013 the article was published in The Tribune 206680758 \u2013 the article's unique identifier As you can see, you can use the newspaper and article ids to create direct links into Trove: to a newspaper or gazette https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/[newspaper id] to an article http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article[article id] Similarly, if you've asked for copies of the articles as images, they'll be in a directory named image . The image file names are similar to the text files, but with an extra id number for the page from which the image was extracted. So, for example, the image filename 19250411-460-140772994-11900413.jpg tells you: 19250411 \u2013 the article was published on 11 April 1925 (YYYYMMDD) 460 \u2013 the article was published in The Australasian 140772994 \u2013 the article's unique identifier 11900413 \u2013 the page's unique identifier (some articles can be split over multiple pages) Once you have your data you can start exploring!

So this means the directory with the largest number will contain the most recent harvest. The harvester saves your results inside this directory. There will be at least two files created for each harvest: results.csv \u2013 a text file containing the details of all harvested articles metadata.json \u2013 a configuration file which stores all the details of the harvest The results.csv file is a plain text CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. You can open it with any spreadsheet program. The details recorded for each article are: article_id \u2013 a unique identifier for the article title \u2013 the title of the article newspaper_id \u2013 a unique identifier for the newspaper or gazette title (this can be used to retrieve more information or build a link to the web interface) newspaper_title \u2013 the name of the newspaper (or gazette) page \u2013 page number (of course), but might also indicate the page is part of a supplement or special section date \u2013 in ISO format, YYYY-MM-DD category \u2013 one of \u2018Article\u2019, \u2018Advertising\u2019, \u2018Detailed lists, results, guides\u2019, \u2018Family Notices\u2019, or \u2018Literature\u2019 words \u2013 number of words in the article illustrated \u2013 is it illustrated (values are y or n) corrections \u2013 number of text corrections url \u2013 the persistent url for the article page_url \u2013 the persistent url of the page on which the article is published If you\u2019ve asked for PDFs or text files, there will be additional directories containing those files. Files containing the OCRd text of the articles will be saved in a directory named text . These are just plain text files, stripped on any HTML. These files include some basic metadata in their file titles \u2013 the date of the article, the id number of the newspaper, and the id number of the article. So, for example, the filename 19460104-1002-206680758.txt tells you: 19460104 \u2013 the article was published on 4 January 1946 (YYYYMMDD) 1002 \u2013 the article was published in The Tribune 206680758 \u2013 the article's unique identifier As you can see, you can use the newspaper and article ids to create direct links into Trove: to a newspaper or gazette https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/[newspaper id] to an article http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article[article id] Similarly, if you've asked for copies of the articles as images, they'll be in a directory named image . The image file names are similar to the text files, but with an extra id number for the page from which the image was extracted. So, for example, the image filename 19250411-460-140772994-11900413.jpg tells you: 19250411 \u2013 the article was published on 11 April 1925 (YYYYMMDD) 460 \u2013 the article was published in The Australasian 140772994 \u2013 the article's unique identifier 11900413 \u2013 the page's unique identifier (some articles can be split over multiple pages) Once you have your data you can start exploring!

Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder Save a Trove newspaper article as an image \u00b6 Sometimes you want to be able to save a Trove newspaper article as an image. Unfortunately, the Trove web interface doesn't make this easy. The 'Download JPG' option actually loads an HTML page, and while you could individually save the images embedded in the HTML page, often articles are sliced up in ways that make the whole thing hard to read and use. This notebook grabs the page on which an article was published, and then crops the page image to the boundaries of the article. The result is a complete, intact image which presents the article as it was originally published. And if the article is split across multiple pages, you'll get one image per page. Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder Run as an app using Voila (the easiest, no code option!)

Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder in Appmode Run as an app using Voila Make composite images from lots of Trove newspaper thumbnails \u00b6 This notebook starts with a search in Trove's newspapers. It uses the Trove API to work its way through the search results. For each article it creates a thumbnail image using the code from this notebook. Once this first stage is finished, you have a directory full of lots of thumbnails. The next stage takes all those thumbnails and pastes them one by one into a BIG image to create a composite, or mosaic. Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder Create 'scissors and paste' messages from Trove newspaper articles \u00b6 When you search for a term in Trove's digitised newspapers and click on individual article, you'll see your search terms are highlighted. If you look at the code you'll see the highlighted box around the word includes its page coordinates. That means that if we search for a word, we can find where it appears on a page, and by cropping the page to those coordinates we can create an image of an individual word. By combining these images we can create scissors and paste style messages!

As well as uploading the article metadata, it attaches image(s) and PDFs of the articles, and creates a linked record for the publishing newspaper. The source of the articles can be a Trove search, a Trove list, a Zotero collection, or just a list of article ids. Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder Harvest Australian Women's Weekly covers (or the front pages of any newspaper) \u00b6 Somewhat confusingly, the Australian Women's Weekly is in with Trove's digitised newspapers and not the rest of the magazines. There are notebooks in the GLAM Workbench's journals section to help harvest all of a journal's covers as images, so I thought I should do the same for the Weekly. This notebook can be easily adjusted to download the front pages of any digitised newspaper.

Version 2 of the API added a separate option to get details of government gazettes. However the original newspaper/titles requests actually returns both the newspaper and gazette titles, so there's no way of getting just the newspaper titles.

This repository includes some alternative ways of retrieving random-ish works and newspaper articles from Trove. While I've tried to mix things up and get as deep into the results set as possible, it's likely that some items are still inaccessible. So while the results will appear random, they may in fact be filtered due to the way facets are applied and delivered through the API. I hope that in the future Trove will provide a random sort option to avoid these problems. Tips, tools, and examples \u00b6 Get an random newspaper article from Trove \u00b6 This method searches for a random stop word, letter, or digit, then filters the results by randomly applying facets until the result set is less that 100 (or as near as possible). It then randomly selects one of the results. You can supply your own queries, or specific facet values to limit the result set. Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder Get a random work from Trove by generating random id s \u00b6 Here's a way you can get a random work from Trove's book, article, picture, map, music, or collection zones. It generates random work id prefixes and performs a wildcard search using the id index. If the prefix returns no results, a digit is sliced off the end. If a prefix returns more than 100 results, a digit is added to the end. This continues until the result set hits the sweet spot between 0 and 100. You can apply values for top-level facets like Format , but going too deep into the facet hierarchy will mean the id search will generate more misses. If you want to apply your own queries or facets, try the method below. Download from GitHub View using NBViewer Run live on Binder Get a random work from Trove using queries and facets \u00b6 Here's another way you can get a random work from Trove's book, article, picture, map, music, or collection zones. This approach is particularly useful if you want to get a random result from a search, or want to apply a variety of facets. It's not as quick as pinging random work ids at Trove, but it's more flexible. Basically this method gets all the available facets for a particular search. If the search has more than 100 results, it chooses one of the facets at random and applies it. It keeps doing this until the search returns less that 100 results. Then it chooses a work at random from the results. If you don't supply a query, it uses a random stop word to mix things up a bit.

Just follow these instructions . What's an API? \u00b6 An API is an Application Programming Interface. It's a set of predefined requests and responses that enables computer programs talk to each other. Web APIs are generally used to deliver data. While humans can easily interpret information on a web page, computers need more help. APIs provide data in a form that computers can understand and use (we call this machine-readable data). The Trove API works much like the Trove website. You make queries and you get back results. But instead of going through a nicely-designed web interface, requests to the API are just URLs, and the results are just structured data. While you can just type an API request into the location box of your web browser, most of the time requests and responses will be handled by a computer script or program. APIs don't care what programming language you use as long as you structure requests in the way they expect. In these notebooks we'll be using the programming language Python.

Seeing differently \u00b6 Activity 1: A different perspective on Trove \u00b6 What do you know about Trove\u2019s newspapers? Open up the Newspapers home page . Search for something you\u2019re interested in. What do we know about that search? What\u2019s in the results? How do they change over time? What\u2019s missing? Go to QueryPic Deconstructed . (It might take a little while to load \u2013 just be patient!) Enter your Trove API key. Enter the same search term in the box and click Add query . Click Create chart . What do you see? Anything interesting or unexpected? Try entering multiple search terms. (Just hit Add query to add each term or Clear all to start again.) What has changed from the standard search interface? How might you use this in your own research? Collections as data \u00b6 We already use GLAM collections in our research, why would we want to access and analyse GLAM data directly? Why would we want collections as data ? Shift scales \u2013 zoom in and out, see your searches in a range of contexts Find patterns \u2013 look for shifts in language, the impact of events or policies, changes over time and space Extract features \u2013 find people, places, and events Make connections \u2013 build contexts, identify gaps and overlaps To help people explore these sorts of possibilities, I've been assembling examples based on the collections of a variety of GLAM institutions. The GLAM Workbench is not about specific tools or technologies, it\u2019s about introducing opportunities for seeing GLAM collections differently. It\u2019s a collection of examples for you to use, change, and hopefully learn from. The GLAM Workbench makes heavy use of Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is a web-based framework that lets you create and share 'computational narratives' \u2013 web pages that blend live code with text, images, examples and more. They break down the distinction between tool and tutorial, enabling you to undertake useful tasks while learning about what's going on underneath the hood. Here\u2019s a 7 minute intro to the GLAM Workbench\u2026 And here's a slightly longer discussion of some of the possibilities of working with collections as data\u2026 But what is GLAM data? \u00b6 GLAM data can take many forms and have a range of characteristics. It's not just a matter of the content of the data, but also how it's controlled, structured, and shared that affects what we can do with it. Working with GLAM data means constantly grappling with questions of access and usability. Here are a few categories of GLAM data you might meet. There are lots of overlaps between these categories, but it's a place to start. Metadata (not content) Structured text / data Unstructured text Images Derived data User generated data Activity data Born digital data Metadata \u00b6 Data about data! In regards to GLAM collections we\u2019re probably talking about the sorts of descriptive information you might find in a catalogue or collection database rather than the digitised objects themselves. Examples: Closed Access \u2013 What files in the National Archives of Australia are closed to public access? What can we know about what we\u2019re not allowed to see? You can harvest your own dataset using this notebook . Datasets from 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 are available on Figshare. Exploring digitised maps in Trove \u2013 I knew the NLA had been had been creating a lot of high-res digital version of historic maps. But how many, and how big? Structured data or text \u00b6 Think data with rows and columns, the sort of thing you might open with a spreadsheet program; although you might also find more complex GLAM data as XML or JSON. The main thing is that the data is organised into fields. This should enable us to do things with the data in those fields. If a field contains dates, for example, we could chart them over time, or extract the years. We sometimes also call this sort of data 'machine readable'. Of course this assumes that the data has been formatted consistently, and as anyone who works with GLAM data will tell you, this is a dangerous assumption to make... Examples: Here's more than 900 GLAM datasets (!) harvested from government data portals. Here\u2019s a big, human-readable list of the datasets. NSW State Archives online indexes \u2013 64 different indexes containing 1,499,259 rows of data! Activity 2: GLAM CSV Explorer \u00b6 What sort of structure does structured data have and how can we use it to help us understand the content? Let's have a little play with the GLAM CSV Explorer which generates automatic previews of more than 500 CSV files harvested from data.gov.au. There's not much to it: Go to the live version . Select a file from the dropdown list and click the button. Rinse and repeat. Do you get a sense of the types of data in the files? Unstructured text \u00b6 Of course text has structure. It has sentences and paragraphs and nouns and proper nouns and verbs, and even punctuation. But most of these structures are implicit, they're not neatly labeled for us to extract and manipulate. We can train computers to find those structures, but it's not a simple process. Examples: Commonwealth Hansard, 1901\u201380 \u2013 Ok, so this is a bit of a structured/unstructured hybrid. The spoken text, as recorded by Hansard, is itself unstructured, but it's embedded in nicely-structured XML files that include information about who spoke the text and when. Whatever it is, there's a lot of it! Trove journals \u2013 As well as newspapers, Trove includes a growing range of digitised journals. Like the newspapers, they've been OCRd and you can download the full text. To save you a lot of pointing and clicking I've harvested the text of 30,462 issues from 384 journals. That's 7gb of text. Get your bulk downloads here! Images \u00b6 Images are data too \u2013 they can be processed and manipulated in all sorts of interesting ways to expose features and patterns. Sometimes we might also want to find particular types of images amongst a large collection. Examples: 'How hard would it be to find the infamous full page editorial cartoons in the Bulletin ?', I foolishly wondered. After several false starts and much trial and error, I ended up with a collection of 3.471 cartoons \u2013 at least one for every issue from 1886 to 1952. The gory details are in this notebook. For more images in bulk, you could try harvesting the covers of a journal in Trove (some of them are really beautiful). Or what about downloading all the digitised files from a series in the National Archives of Australia (NAA). Someone [name redacted] might have already harvested all the publicly available ASIO surveillance files. Derived data \u00b6 Sometimes in processing GLAM data we create new GLAM data that highlights particular features, provides new access points, or adds structure and context. Yay, more data! Examples: Finding faces \u2013 I started playing around with facial detection software about 8 years ago when I created this wall of faces from NAA records used in the administration of the White Australia policy. I still think its an interesting way of changing our perspective on large photographic collections. Here's some more recent experiments with photos from the State Library of NSW's Tribune collection. If you've ever wanted a collection of 200,000 redactions extracted from ASIO surveillance files, have I got a dataset for you \u2013 images , metadata, and even a browsable interface . But watch out for the #redactionart ! User generated data \u00b6 The users of GLAM collections can also create data \u2013 through crowdsourced transcription projects, by adding tags and comments to guide others, or by building and sharing their own collections. We set up the Real Face of White Australia project to transcribe structured data from forms used in the administration of the White Australia Policy. The data itself is shared through its own repository , and used to build tweet-sized stories . I love Trove lists because they're an insight into people's passions (do you know the story of lawnmower man ?). But you can also extract data about Trove lists to explore their contents at scale . Activity data \u00b6 Changes made to collections can also be recorded and shared. Here's a notebook that explores patterns in the OCR corrections volunteers have made to Trove's newspapers. And if you want up-to-date info, here's a live OCR Correction Ticker . Unpacking interfaces, exploring data, & thinking critically \u00b6 It's rarely the case that we can just download and use GLAM data. Even when the data is openly-licensed, well-structured, and easy to access, we still have to spend time getting to know it. What are its limits, and its assumptions? Many of the notebooks in the GLAM Workbench are intended to help with this exploratory phase. Before you can use GLAM data, you have to play with it. From here on we're going to working with live Jupyter notebooks running on Binder. In actual fact, you already have, because QueryPic and the CSV Explorer were also live notebooks, it's just that they were running with all the code hidden. But now you'll get a chance to see and change the code. Jupyter notebooks quick start Don't panic! Jupyter notebooks are meant to encourage experimentation, so don't feel nervous. Just try running a few cells and see what happens! Here's some hints: Code cells have boxes around them. To run a code cell click on the cell and then hit Shift+Enter . The Shift+Enter combo will also move you to the next cell, so it's a quick way to work through the notebook. While a cell is running a * appears in the square brackets next to the cell. Once the cell has finished running the asterix will be replaced with a number. In most cases you'll want to start from the top of notebook and work your way down running each cell in turn. Later cells might depend on the results of earlier ones. To edit a code cell, just click on it and type stuff. Remember to run the cell once you've finished editing. Activity 3: Trove newspapers over time \u00b6 Let's go back again to QueryPic and explore the sorts of assumptions we need to unpack when we're exploring Trove's newspapers over time. Just click on the links below to launch the notebooks on Binder. Then just follow the instructions, hitting Shift+Enter on each cell to run it. You'll need to have your Trove API key ready to insert where indicated. Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state Hopefully these notebooks will give you a sense of how the nature of the digitised newspapers themselves can be critically analysed. Activity 4: What's in the National Museum of Australia? \u00b6 As I mentioned, you have to spend time playing around to understand both the limits and the possibilities of a new dataset. Recently the National Museum of Australia opened up access to its collection data through an API. Here's some notebooks that poke about inside... Note that I've pre-harvested the objects and places data. But before you start working on it, you'll need to follow the link to unzip the data file. Start by exploring object records Click on the 'unzip a pre-harvested dataset' link and run the cell in the linked notebook to prepare the data. Work through the 'Exploring object records' notebook. Think about the sorts of metadata that have been captured. When you've run all the cells, click on the link to the 'time' notebook at the top of the page. This notebook explores the temporal dimensions of the data. When were objects created or collected? There's a few puzzles along the way! When you've run all the cells, click on the link to 'explore places'. This notebook unpacks spatial information and creates some maps. What's missing from the NMA data? What other perspectives might we explore? Activity 5: Exploring the text of Trove's journals \u00b6 What sort of patterns can we observe across the issues of a journal? Let's try working with some unstructured text. Apologies in advance \u2013 this notebook is hot off the presses and is missing a lot of documentation. But just work it using the trusty ol' Shift+Enter and you should see some magic happen. You'll need to select a journal from the dropdown list and then download the OCRd text from the repository on CloudStor. For this exercise, I'd suggest you start by selecting something that doesn't have more than a few hundred issues \u2013 Art in Australia for example. Word frequencies in digitised journals Lunch break \u00b6 Handy hints & hacks \u00b6 Sometimes things that should be easy, aren't. This applies to GLAM collections as much as it does to everything else in life. But at least in the case of GLAM collections we can build and share hacks and hints to overcome at least some of the frustrations. Activity 6: Get an image of a newspaper article in Trove \u00b6 You can download just dowload a newspaper article from the Trove web interface can't you? Well, sort of. You can generate an HTML page which embeds images of the article, although they might be sliced up in strange ways that make them almost unreadable. Sigh... It's often easier just to do a screen capture. But here's an alternative. Find an article in Trove. For bonus points find an illustrated article spread over more than one page. Click here When the page has loaded, paste the article url into the box. Hit the Get Images button! Download your image. You might have guessed that this little app is another Jupyter notebook in disguise. Here's a few other apps/notebooks that you might find handy for getting or moving data. Apps: Create a thumbnail image from a Trove newspaper article Save a Trove newspaper page as a (high-res) image Download the contents of a digitised file from RecordSearch Notebooks: Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka-S Convert a Trove list into a CSV file First catch your data \u00b6 One thing we haven't really covered yet is where you find GLAM data and how do you get it in a usable form. As a starting point, I've created a list of GLAM data sources . But as I suggested earlier, access is not a straightforward thing \u2013 just because data is online, doesn't mean it's easy to download or use. Here's some of the real world categories of GLAM data that we often have to deal with: Machine-readable but coding required for download Downloadable but not easily findable Structured but not downloadable Downloadable but in many separate pieces Machine-readable but coding required for download \u00b6 Trove makes a lot (but not all!) of its collection data available via an API (Application Programming Interface). So do other GLAM institutions like the NMA and the Museums Victoria. I love APIs, but to get data out of them you need to be able to code. How do we fill the gap between APIs and the researchers who want to use the data they provide? Here's some notebooks that provide an interface between you and the API, making it easy to explore and download the data you're interested in. Trove newspaper harvester Harvest records from the NMA API DigitalNZ \u2013 New Zealand's Trove! Te Papa collection API Downloadable but not easily findable \u00b6 I've already mentioned that there's lots of GLAM datasets available through the data.gov.au portal, but who would have known it? In total there's 948 datasets from 22 organisations . Some of these are more interesting than others, but there\u2019s some really rich historical data amongst them. However, unless you know where to look they can be hard to find. Datasets are often buried deep in organisational websites, and while data.gov.au has a good search interface, how many people would think to look there for data from libraries? Structured but not downloadable \u00b6 Other than Trove, the collection I\u2019ve spent most time wrestling with is that of the National Archives of Australia. The NAA\u2019s online database, RecordSearch , doesn\u2019t provide an API or download options, so to get data out you have to resort to a process known as screen-scraping \u2014 you have to write some code to extract the data you want from web pages. However, the data in RecordSearch is really rich and complex, so it\u2019s worth the effort. Another example in this category are the indexes to records created by the NSW State Archives and their volunteers. These indexes include things like names, places, and dates, and provide useful entry points into the records. But they\u2019re also rich datasets. The indexes are openly licensed, they\u2019re online, they\u2019re searchable, but there\u2019s no way of downloading them except by screen scraping. So I\u2019ve harvested all the indexes and made them available as CSV files . Screen scrapers are kludgey and prone to breakage, but sometimes it't the only way to get useable data out of GLAM websites. Here's some more examples: Harvest a series from RecordSearch Harvesting functions from the RecordSearch interface Harvesting a records search from Archway (Archives of New Zealand) Harvest the Library and Archives Canada naturalisation database, 1915-1946, by country Downloadable but in many separate pieces \u00b6 As I mentioned early on, when you work with collections as data you can play around with scale, zooming out from a single instance to look for patterns across thousands of files. But this is difficult if you\u2019re only option is to manually download one file at a time. To make useful data our of a collection, sometimes you just have to bring the pieces together. Commonwealth Hansard is an example of this. Sitting underneath the ParlInfo search interface are a lot of well-structured XML files, one for each sitting day in the Senate and House of Reps. But you can only download them manually \u2014 one at a time. I\u2019ve harvested all the XML files from 1901 to 1980 and saved them to a separate repository. All those separate files have become a corpus for large-scale text analysis. The same goes for the transcripts of more than 20,000 speeches, media releases, and interviews by Australian Prime Ministers made available online by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. They're online, they have metadata, and they're downloadable as XML files. But by harvesting them and making them easily downloadable in bulk, we change what's possible. Trove\u2019s API is great, but there\u2019s some important data you can\u2019t get through it \u2013 the content of Trove\u2019s digitised journals , for example, can only be accessed through the web interface. I\u2019ve created a series of notebooks to help you extract metadata, text, and digitised page images from the journals. To do this I've supplemented what's available through the API with extra data from screen scraping, and some reverse engineering of the web interface. I've done the same for Trove's digitised books . Finding pathways \u00b6 How do we start to put all this bits and pieces together in a way that allows researchers to pursue the questions that interest them across collections? Let's experiment with one possible pathway. Activity 7: Zoom out, zoom in \u00b6 First go back once again to the QueryPic visualisation of newspaper searches over time. But this time, I want you to play around with search terms until you find something you think might be worth exploring further. Perhaps there's an unexpected peak, or an interesting shift in usage between particular words. Once you have identified your feature of interest, head to the Trove web interface and construct a search that focuses on that feature. For example, you might use the facets to filter your search by year, state, newspaper, or article type. For the purposes of this exercise, you want to limit the number of results in your search to a few thousand at most. (This is just so you don't spend the rest of the workshop waiting for your 253,000 newspaper articles to download...) Copy the url of your Trove search. Now we're going to feed your search url to the Trove Newspaper Harvester . Once again, you'll need your Trove API key . Just paste your API query and your search url into the boxes where indicated. Run the cell that says %run -m troveharvester -- start $query $api_key --text to start your harvest. The Trove Newspaper Harvester is actually a command line tool, but I've embedded in this notebook to make it easier to use. There's also an app-ified version that makes it even easier! The Newspaper Harvester downloads both the metadata about the articles in your search, and the OCRd text of each individual article. This means that we can explore the content of the articles in depth. It's worth remembering too that the Trove web interface only lets you see the first 2,000 articles in your search. The Newspaper Harvester can download many thousands of articles. I recently harvested more than half a million articles to explore the changing context of the words 'aliens' and 'immigrants' . The notebook includes information on the structure of the metadata file. Once your harvest is finished, click on the link at the bottom of the notebook that says 'Exploring your TroveHarvester data' to load a new notebook. This notebook tries analysing the metadata file you just harvested in a number of different ways. It breaks the results down by newspaper, by time, and by place of publication. It also looks at the frequencies of words in the article titles. It's in need of an overhaul, but it's a useful starting point. Once you've got some sense of the harvested metadata, it's time to look at the text contents of the articles themselves. Click on the link at the bottom of the notebook to explore word frequencies in the text content of the articles. This notebook calculates word frequencies for each article and then aggregates these counts by year. You can also explore how the frequency of particular words change over time. Under 'Visualise word frequencies over time' there's a cell where you can enter words that you want to investigate. Visualise the results as both a facet chart and a bubbleline chart. Once you're ready to move on, click on the link at the bottom to open a notebook that calculates TF-IDF values for words in the articles. TF-IDF scores are calculated by comparing the number of time a word appears in a single document to the number of times it appears in a collection of documents. Word frequencies point us to 'common' words, TF-IDF can indicate 'significant' words. This notebook aggregates the articles by year and then calculates TF-IDF values for each word in each year. Once again you can explore how the TF-IDF values of specific words change over time. So, did you find anything interesting? The point of this exercise was not to define a specific methodology, but to suggest different ways you might pursue a set of research questions through a number of shifts in scale. Of course there are many other things we could do to explore the article text (and more will be added to the GLAM Workbench in time). We could for example look for clusters amongst the articles by using topic modelling. Here's a great notebook by Adel Rahmani that explores topic modelling of Australian parliamentary press releases harvested via Trove.

The main thing is that the data is organised into fields. This should enable us to do things with the data in those fields. If a field contains dates, for example, we could chart them over time, or extract the years. We sometimes also call this sort of data 'machine readable'. Of course this assumes that the data has been formatted consistently, and as anyone who works with GLAM data will tell you, this is a dangerous assumption to make... Examples: Here's more than 900 GLAM datasets (!) harvested from government data portals. Here\u2019s a big, human-readable list of the datasets.

The spoken text, as recorded by Hansard, is itself unstructured, but it's embedded in nicely-structured XML files that include information about who spoke the text and when. Whatever it is, there's a lot of it! Trove journals \u2013 As well as newspapers, Trove includes a growing range of digitised journals.

From here on we're going to working with live Jupyter notebooks running on Binder.

The NAA\u2019s online database, RecordSearch , doesn\u2019t provide an API or download options, so to get data out you have to resort to a process known as screen-scraping \u2014 you have to write some code to extract the data you want from web pages. However, the data in RecordSearch is really rich and complex, so it\u2019s worth the effort. Another example in this category are the indexes to records created by the NSW State Archives and their volunteers. These indexes include things like names, places, and dates, and provide useful entry points into the records. But they\u2019re also rich datasets. The indexes are openly licensed, they\u2019re online, they\u2019re searchable, but there\u2019s no way of downloading them except by screen scraping. So I\u2019ve harvested all the indexes and made them available as CSV files . Screen scrapers are kludgey and prone to breakage, but sometimes it't the only way to get useable data out of GLAM websites.

But this is difficult if you\u2019re only option is to manually download one file at a time. To make useful data our of a collection, sometimes you just have to bring the pieces together. Commonwealth Hansard is an example of this. Sitting underneath the ParlInfo search interface are a lot of well-structured XML files, one for each sitting day in the Senate and House of Reps. But you can only download them manually \u2014 one at a time. I\u2019ve harvested all the XML files from 1901 to 1980 and saved them to a separate repository. All those separate files have become a corpus for large-scale text analysis. The same goes for the transcripts of more than 20,000 speeches, media releases, and interviews by Australian Prime Ministers made available online by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. They're online, they have metadata, and they're downloadable as XML files. But by harvesting them and making them easily downloadable in bulk, we change what's possible.

But this time, I want you to play around with search terms until you find something you think might be worth exploring further. Perhaps there's an unexpected peak, or an interesting shift in usage between particular words. Once you have identified your feature of interest, head to the Trove web interface and construct a search that focuses on that feature. For example, you might use the facets to filter your search by year, state, newspaper, or article type. For the purposes of this exercise, you want to limit the number of results in your search to a few thousand at most. (This is just so you don't spend the rest of the workshop waiting for your 253,000 newspaper articles to download...) Copy the url of your Trove search. Now we're going to feed your search url to the Trove Newspaper Harvester . Once again, you'll need your Trove API key . Just paste your API query and your search url into the boxes where indicated. Run the cell that says %run -m troveharvester -- start $query $api_key --text to start your harvest. The Trove Newspaper Harvester is actually a command line tool, but I've embedded in this notebook to make it easier to use. There's also an app-ified version that makes it even easier! The Newspaper Harvester downloads both the metadata about the articles in your search, and the OCRd text of each individual article. This means that we can explore the content of the articles in depth. It's worth remembering too that the Trove web interface only lets you see the first 2,000 articles in your search. The Newspaper Harvester can download many thousands of articles. I recently harvested more than half a million articles to explore the changing context of the words 'aliens' and 'immigrants' . The notebook includes information on the structure of the metadata file. Once your harvest is finished, click on the link at the bottom of the notebook that says 'Exploring your TroveHarvester data' to load a new notebook. This notebook tries analysing the metadata file you just harvested in a number of different ways. It breaks the results down by newspaper, by time, and by place of publication. It also looks at the frequencies of words in the article titles. It's in need of an overhaul, but it's a useful starting point. Once you've got some sense of the harvested metadata, it's time to look at the text contents of the articles themselves. Click on the link at the bottom of the notebook to explore word frequencies in the text content of the articles. This notebook calculates word frequencies for each article and then aggregates these counts by year. You can also explore how the frequency of particular words change over time. Under 'Visualise word frequencies over time' there's a cell where you can enter words that you want to investigate. Visualise the results as both a facet chart and a bubbleline chart. Once you're ready to move on, click on the link at the bottom to open a notebook that calculates TF-IDF values for words in the articles. TF-IDF scores are calculated by comparing the number of time a word appears in a single document to the number of times it appears in a collection of documents. Word frequencies point us to 'common' words, TF-IDF can indicate 'significant' words. This notebook aggregates the articles by year and then calculates TF-IDF values for each word in each year. Once again you can explore how the TF-IDF values of specific words change over time. So, did you find anything interesting? The point of this exercise was not to define a specific methodology, but to suggest different ways you might pursue a set of research questions through a number of shifts in scale. Of course there are many other things we could do to explore the article text (and more will be added to the GLAM Workbench in time). We could for example look for clusters amongst the articles by using topic modelling. Here's a great notebook by Adel Rahmani that explores topic modelling of Australian parliamentary press releases harvested via Trove.","title":"Activity 7: Zoom out, zoom in"},{"location":"umdigitalstudio2019/#suggestions-welcome","text":"If you have suggestions for data sources, tools, or examples to add the GLAM Workbench, feel free to add them via GitHub .","title":"Suggestions welcome"},{"location":"umdigitalstudio2019/#additional-readings-and-resources","text":"Here's a few sites and resources that came up in discussion: Explore Trove's digitised journals Hansard interjections as tweets Trove tips & tricks Digital Humanities Slack \u2013 Join me in the #dh-australia channel!","title":"Additional readings and resources"},{"location":"web-archives/","text":"Web Archives \u00b6 We tend to think of a web archive as a site we go to when links are broken \u2013 a useful fallback, rather than a source of new research data.

This collection of notebooks is intended to help historians, and other researchers, frame those questions by revealing what sort of data is available, how to get it, and what you can do with it. Web Archives share systems and standards, making it much easier for researchers wanting to get their hands on useful data. These notebooks focus on four particular web archives: the UK Web Archive , the Australian Web Archive (National Library of Australia ), the New Zealand Web Archive (National Library of New Zealand), and the Internet Archive . However, the tools and approaches here could be easily extended to other web archives. Web archives are huge, and access is often limited for legal reasons. These notebooks focus on data that is readily accessible and able to be used without the need for special equipment. They use existing APIs to get data in manageable chunks. But many of the examples demonstrated can also be scaled up to build substantial datasets for analysis \u2013 you just have to be patient! These notebooks are a starting point that I hope will encourage researchers to investigate the possibilities of web archives in more detail. They're intended to compliment the fabulous work being by projects such as Archives Unleashed to open web archives to new research uses. The development of these notebooks was supported by the International Internet Preservation Consortium's Discretionary Funding Programme 2019-2020 , with the participation of the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. Thanks all! For more information on web archives projects, training, technologies, and standards see the Awesome Web Archiving list. Types of data \u00b6 As noted, we're focusing here on on web archive data that's freely available through APIs.

Timegates, Timemaps, and Mementos \u00b6 Works with AWA, NZWA, IA, & UKWA Systems supporting the Memento protocol provide machine-readable information about web archive captures, even if other APIs are not available.

As in other notebooks, we'll obtain the data by querying the Internet Archive's CDX API. The only real difference is that it will take some hours to harvest all the data.

Using Memento Timemaps, it gets a list of available captures from the selected web archive. It then searches each capture for the desired text, displaying the results. You can select the direction in which the notebook searches: First occurrence \u2013 find the first capture in which the text appears (start from the first capture and come forward in time) Last occurrence \u2013 find the last capture in which the text appears (start from present and go backwards in time) All occurrences \u2013 find all matches (start from the first capture and continue until the last) If you select 'All occurrences' the notebook will generate a simple chart showing how the number of matches changes over time.

But many of the examples demonstrated can also be scaled up to build substantial datasets for analysis \u2013 you just have to be patient! These notebooks are a starting point that I hope will encourage researchers to investigate the possibilities of web archives in more detail. They're intended to compliment the fabulous work being by projects such as Archives Unleashed to open web archives to new research uses. The development of these notebooks was supported by the International Internet Preservation Consortium's Discretionary Funding Programme 2019-2020 , with the participation of the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. Thanks all!
