It's aimed at researchers in the humanities, but will include examples and tutorials of more general interest. Over the past decade I've created and shared a wide variety of digital tools, examples, tutorials, and datasets. Some like QueryPic and TroveHarvester are fairly polished and well documented. Others are just fragments of code. All of them are intended to support research into our rich cultural collections. But even though something like the TroveHarvester is pretty easy to use, it does require a bit of set-up, and I've been very aware that this can be a barrier to people starting their explorations. I created the dhistory site many years ago to provide the foundation for a digital workbench, but I couldn't quite achieve what I wanted \u2014 tools that were easy to use and required minimal setup, but also tools that exposed their own workings, that inspired novice users to question and to tinker. So here we are. My plan is to use Jupyter , GitHub, and Binder to bring together all those tools, examples, tutorials, and datasets in a way that supports people's explorations through digital GLAM collections. I'm really excited, for example, that I can create a notebook that provides a deconstructed (or perhaps see-through) version of QueryPic \u2014 that enables you to build, step by step, the same sort of visualisations, while learning about how it works. And at the end you can download the results as a CSV for further analysis. I love the way that Jupyter notebooks combine learning with real, live, digital tools and methods. You don't have to read a tutorial then go away and try to follow the instructions on your own. It's all together. Live code. Real research. Active learning. Like most of my projects this is in itself an experiment. I'm still learning what's possible and what works. But I'm hopeful. If you think this project is worthwhile, you might like to support me on Patreon .","title":"Some background"},{"location":"archway/","text":"Archway \u00b6 Archway is the collections database of Archives New Zealand and provides rich, contextual information about records, series, agencies, and functions.

Here's the number of datasets by data portal: data.gov.au 271 data.qld.gov.au 214 data.sa.gov.au 173 data.wa.gov.au 96 data.nsw.gov.au 30 data.vic.gov.au 6 And the number of datasets by organisation: State Library of South Australia 121 Housing and Public Works 117 State Library of Western Australia 114 Natural Resources, Mines and Energy 79 State Library of Queensland 78 LINC Tasmania 74 State Records 41 State Records Office of Western Australia 41 South Australian Governments 26 State Library of New South Wales 21 State Archives NSW 19 Environment and Science 14 History Trust of South Australia 12 State Library of NSW 6 State Library of Victoria 6 National Library of Australia 5 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships 4 Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences 3 National Archives of Australia 3 National Portrait Gallery 2 Mount Gambier Library 2 Australian Museum 1 City of Sydney 1 I've attempted to identify the format of each dataset by checking the file extension. If there's no file extension I use the format value in the package metadata. These values don't always seem reliable. Here's the number of datasets by format: csv 499 xml 66 wms 35 xlsx 27 json 25 docx 17 xls 16 txt 15 zip 14 doc 12 api 12 geojson 8 other 7 data 6 pdf 4 jpg 2 html 2 rss 2 website link 2 kml 2 rtf 2 kmz 1 css, java, php, javascript 1 php 1 xsd 1 csv, json, web services 1 mp3 1 js 1 museum 1 website 1 app 1 jpeg 1 url 1 .txt 1 wfs 1 plain 1 For each dataset, I've fired off a HEAD request for the url to see if the link still works.

These files have been through the access examination process and ended up with an access status of 'closed'.

Harvesting functions from the RecordSearch interface \u00b6 This notebook attempts to extract information from the RecordSearch interface about the hierarchy of functions it uses to describe the work of government agencies. Previous explorations have shown that the NAA's use of functions is rather inconsistent. All I'm doing here is finding out what functions RecordSearch itself says it is using. This may not be complete, but it seems like a useful starting point.

A function is an area of responsibility assigned to a particular government agency. Over time, functions change and move between agencies.

You can access metadata from the book zone through the Trove API. Tips, tools, and examples \u00b6 Create a list of Trove's digitised journals \u00b6 Everyone know's about Trove's newspapers, but there is also a growing collection of digitised journals available in the journals zone. They're not easy to find, however, which is why I created the Trove Titles web app. This notebook uses the Trove API to harvest metadata relating to digitised journals \u2013 or more accurately, journals that are freely available online in a digital form. This includes some born digital publications that are available to view in formats like PDF and MOBI, but excludes some digital journals that have access restrictions. Get OCRd text from a digitised journal in Trove \u00b6 Many of the digitised journals available in Trove make OCRd text available for download \u2013 one text file for each journal issue. However, while there are records for journals and articles in Trove (and available through the API), there are no records for issues. So how do we find them? This notebook shows how to extract issue data from a digitised journal and download OCRd text for each issue. Get covers (or any other pages) from a digitised journal in Trove \u00b6 In another notebook, I showed how to get issue metadata and OCRd texts from a digitised journal in Trove. It's also possible to download page images and PDFs. This notebook shows how to download all the cover images from a specified journal. With some minor modifications you could download any page, or range of pages. Download the OCRd text for ALL the digitised journals in Trove! \u00b6 Using the code and data from the previous two notebooks, you can download the OCRd text from every digitised journal. If you're going to try this, you'll need a lots of patience and lots of disk space. Needless to say, don't try this on a cloud service like Binder. Fortunately you don't have to do it yourself, as I've already run the harvest and made all the text files available. See below for details. I repeat, you probably don't want to do this yourself. The point of this notebook is really to document the methodology used to create the repository. Harvest parliament press releases from Trove \u00b6 Trove includes more than 370,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. You can view them all in Trove by searching for nuc:\"APAR:PR\" in the journals zone. This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and full text from a search of the parliamentary press releases. The metadata is available from Trove, but to get the full text we have to go back to the Parliamentary Library's database, ParlInfo. Harvesting data from the Bulletin \u00b6 This is a more specific example of harvesting metadata and OCRd text from a digitised journal, in this case The Bulletin . It also shows how you can get the front cover images (or any other page). Finding editorial cartoons in the Bulletin \u00b6 In another notebook I showed how you could download all the front pages of The Bulletin (and other journals) as images. Amongst the front pages you'll find a number of full page editorial cartoons under The Bulletin's masthead. But you'll also find that many of the front pages are advertising wrap arounds. The full page editorial cartoons were a consistent feature of The Bulletin for many decades, but they moved around between pages one and eleven. That makes them hard to find. I wanted to try and assemble a collection of all the editorial cartoons, but how? Harvesting data from Home \u00b6 This is a more specific example of harvesting metadata and OCRd text from a digitised journal, in this case The Home . It also shows how you can get the front cover images (or any other page). Topic Modelling of Australian Parliamentary Press Releases by Adel Rahmani \u00b6 This notebook explores the Politicians talking about 'immigrants' and 'refugees' collection of press releases (see below). Adel notes: 'I was curious about the contents of the press releases, however, at more than 12,000 documents the collection is too overwhelming to read through, so I thought I'd get the computer to do it for me, and use topic modelling to poke aroung the corpus.'

The notebooks in this section provide many examples of using the API to harvest data and analyse the contents of Trove. Before you can use the API you need to obtain a key \u2014 it's free and quick. Just follow these instructions . What's an API? \u00b6 An API is an Application Programming Interface. It's a set of predefined requests and responses that enables computer programs talk to each other. Web APIs are generally used to deliver data. While humans can easily interpret information on a web page, computers need more help. APIs provide data in a form that computers can understand and use (we call this machine-readable data). The Trove API works much like the Trove website. You make queries and you get back results. But instead of going through a nicely-designed web interface, requests to the API are just URLs, and the results are just structured data. While you can just type an API request into the location box of your web browser, most of the time requests and responses will be handled by a computer script or program. APIs don't care what programming language you use as long as you structure requests in the way they expect. In these notebooks we'll be using the programming language Python. No prior knowledge of Python is expected or required -- just follow along! The examples and approaches used could be easily translated into any another programming language. Tools, tips, examples \u00b6 Your first API request \u00b6 In this notebook we're going to learn how to send a request for information to the Trove API. API requests are just like normal urls. However, instead of sending us back a web page, they deliver data in a form that computers can understand. We can then use that data in our own programs. Working with zones \u00b6 Trove's zones are important in constructing API requests and interpreting the results. So let's explore them a bit. Exploring facets \u00b6 Facets aggregate collection data in interesting and useful ways, allowing us to build pictures of the collection. This notebook shows you how to get facet data from Trove.)
